# Fitness Gram Pacer Test Game
Player moves up and down to try to collect points to win. You want to dodge the walls or else you will lose.

## Summary

A game inspired by the pacer test. A dodging game.

## Component Parts
 Scoring system.
 Gradually increase difficulty.
 Collision detection.
 Keypress control.
 
## Challenges
The scoring and hurting sound doesn't always work.
I want the score to add up one at a time instead of rapidly.
I want the player to travel up and down to get the points. Instead of staying one spot.
I want the walls to randomize when it goes to the bottom and does back down. So it's not predictable.
I want the walls to actually progressively speed up as I approach my win score.
