# Fitness Gram Pacer Test Game

Player moves up and down to try to collect points to win. You want to dodge the walls or else you will lose.

## Summary

A paragraph or two describing what you are building for your final project.

Include a discussion of how it will be interactive or responsive to the environment.

## Component Parts
 Scoring system
 Gradually increase difficulty
 Collision detection
 Keypress control
 
## Challenges
The scoring and hurting sound doesn't always work.
I want the score to add up one at a time instead of rapidly.
I want the player to travel up and down to get the points. Instead of staying one spot.
I want the walls to randomize when it goes to the bottom and does back down. So it's not predictable.
I want the walls to actually progressively speed up as I approach my win score.
